Hi [Employee Name],

As part of our company-wide upgrade to Windows 11, we’ve reviewed all hardware assets and identified that your current workstation ([Device Model]) is no longer compatible and has reached its end-of-life.

To ensure a smooth transition and minimize disruption to your work, we will be replacing your device with a new one that fully supports Windows 11.

Next Steps:
	•	If you have any important data stored locally on your current machine (e.g., Desktop, Downloads, local folders), please let us know so we can schedule a data migration session.
	•	Once data migration is complete, we will arrange a desk-side swap at your location (please confirm your desk number if you haven’t already).

Please reply to this email at your earliest convenience to confirm the following:
	1.	Whether you have any local data that needs to be migrated.
	2.	Your desk number for scheduling the device swap.

If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out.

Best regards,
[Your Full Name]
