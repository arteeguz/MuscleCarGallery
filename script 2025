Hello, my name is Artem Guz, and I'm a DSS Summer Analyst with End-User Services at RBC Capital Markets.
During my internship, I've had the opportunity to develop new projects and continue working on projects that I started last year.
My first project is a continuation of last year's work called the Angriest IP Scanner, which evolved from simple PowerShell scripts into a full-featured Windows application with a comprehensive GUI. This year, I enhanced it with hostname and IP segment scanning capabilities that automatically map to office floor locations, and by optimizing parallel processing and smart batching, I improved scanning speeds by 20%. The tool is used daily by the DSS team to detect Windows 10 assets and identify models for either in-place upgrades or physical swaps, capturing over 25 data points per device including hardware specs, software versions, BIOS information, and network configurations. This has saved significant time detecting end-of-life assets - instead of walking each floor and visually identifying old assets, we now scan entire network segments in minutes to instantly find asset names, owners, and specifications, saving roughly 2 hours per floor in asset identification time.
My second project is OfficeOps, which addresses our office space management challenges. Previously, we relied on static Excel files from real estate with no visualization or real-time updates. I developed OfficeOps as a full-stack web application using React and Node.js that transforms how we track office seating.
The system features real-time seat assignment, automated Excel import/export with intelligent conflict resolution, and visual dashboards showing occupancy rates by floor and business group. What used to take hours of manual Excel updates now happens instantly, with a complete audit trail of all changes. It provides visual representation of office spaces and allows users to generate detailed reports based on seat vacancy, business group distribution, transit numbers, and more that can be easily shared with stakeholders.
Thank you for your attention. Now I'll hand it over to my colleague Carolina.
