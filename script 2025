Hello, my name is Artem Guz, and I'm a DSS Summer Analyst with End-User Services at RBC Capital Markets.
During my internship, I've had the opportunity to develop new projects and continue working on projects that I started last year.
My first project is a continuation of last year's work called the Angriest IP Scanner. What started as a small set of PowerShell scripts to detect assets needing hardware and software updates has evolved into a full-featured Windows application with a comprehensive GUI. This year, I enhanced the project with faster scanning speeds and expanded capabilities. It's used daily by the DSS team to detect Windows 10 assets and identify their models to schedule either in-place upgrades or physical asset swaps. This application has saved the DSS team significant time detecting end-of-life assets across our office space. Instead of walking each floor and visually identifying old assets, we now use the IP scanner to instantly find asset names, owners, and specifications. This saves roughly 2 hours per floor in asset identification time.
I added both hostname and IP segment scanning capabilities, which automatically map to office floor locations using predefined network mappings. By optimizing parallel processing and implementing smart batching, I improved scanning speeds by 20%, allowing us to scan entire network segments in just a few minutes. The tool now captures over 25 data points per device, including hardware specs, installed software versions, BIOS information, and network configurations.
My second project is OfficeOps, which addresses our office space management challenges. Previously, we relied on static Excel files from real estate with no visualization or real-time updates. I developed OfficeOps as a full-stack web application using React and Node.js that transforms how we track office seating.
The system features real-time seat assignment, automated Excel import/export with intelligent conflict resolution, and visual dashboards showing occupancy rates by floor and business group. What used to take hours of manual Excel updates now happens instantly, with a complete audit trail of all changes. It provides visual representation of office spaces and allows users to generate detailed reports based on seat vacancy, business group distribution, transit numbers, and more that can be easily shared with stakeholders.
Thank you for your attention. Now I'll hand it over to my colleague Carolina.

My first project is the Angriest IP Scanner, which evolved from PowerShell scripts into a full Windows application. It's used daily by our DSS team to identify Windows 10 assets for our Windows 11 migration, determining which need in-place upgrades versus hardware swaps.

This year, I added hostname and IP segment scanning with automatic floor mapping, improved speeds by 20% through parallel processing, and expanded data capture to over 25 points per device.
My second project, OfficeOps, transforms our office space management from static Excel files to a dynamic web application. Built with React and Node.js, it features real-time seat assignments, automated Excel import/export with conflict resolution, and visual dashboards showing occupancy by floor and business group. What took hours of manual updates now happens instantly with full audit trails. Users can generate and share detailed reports on seat vacancy, business group distribution, and more.
