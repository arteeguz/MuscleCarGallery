This email requires your immediate attention regarding your RBC-issued asset.

**Your Current Asset Status:**
- **Hostname:** [hostname]
- **Status:** End of Life - Not compatible with Windows 11
- **Action Required:** Immediate upgrade needed

**Important Policy Update:**
Per RBC IT Security policy, all assets that cannot run Windows 11 will be removed from the network effective **October 1, 2025**. Your current device [hostname] has reached end of life and cannot be upgraded to Windows 11, making it non-compliant with this policy.

**Your Upgrade Options:**

Please choose one of the following options to receive your replacement asset:

2. **Home Delivery:** Arrange for a new asset to be shipped directly to your residence

To proceed, please reply to this email with your preferred option and availability.

**Already Off the Network?**

If you have been disconnected and need to recover data from your current device, a one-time **5-day exemption** is available. Please reply to this email immediately to request temporary access.

**Critical Reminder:**
Failure to upgrade will result in permanent network disconnection and potential data loss. Please ensure any important local files are backed up or migrated before your asset is decommissioned.

If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Best regards,
