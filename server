# Linux Server Setup Process

## 1. Create NetGroups
**Timeline:** 1-2 days

**What it is:** NetGroups are security groups that control user permissions on UNIX systems.

**Why you need TWO groups:**

* **SUDO Group** - Administrative access group
  * Allows team members to execute commands with root privileges
  * Used for: Installing software, system configuration, troubleshooting
  
* **Service Group** - Application runtime group  
  * For the dedicated application account that runs your service
  * Used for: Running the application, file access permissions

**Why separate groups?** 
Security best practice - applications should run with minimal privileges, while administrative tasks require elevated access only when needed.

**Form:** UNIX Create User NetGroup (submit twice)
**Result:** `tg_UGZ0_n_dev_sudo`, `tg_UGZ0_n_dev_svc`

## 2. Request Linux Server
**Timeline:** 2-5 days

**What it is:** Provisioning a dedicated Linux server for your application.

**Why:** Your application needs a persistent server environment that runs independently of your local development machine.

**Include NetGroups:** Specify which NetGroups should have access to the server during the request process.

**You Get:** Server hostname like `strdlvbugz0001.devfg.rbc.com`

## 3. Add Yourself to NetGroups
**Timeline:** 1 day

**What it is:** Adding your user account to both security groups created in step 1.

**Why BOTH groups?**
* **SUDO Group:** Enables you to perform administrative tasks and system configuration
* **Service Group:** Allows you to manage and troubleshoot the application account

## 4. Create Application ID
**Timeline:** 1-2 days

**What it is:** Creating a dedicated service account for running your application.

**Why not use your personal account?**
* Personal accounts are tied to individual employees
* If you leave the company, the application would stop working
* During time off, no one else can restart or manage the application
* Security risk - the application would have your personal permissions

**Application ID benefits:**
* Generic account like `tg_UGZ0_n_dev_app`
* Runs continuously without requiring user login
* Multiple team members can manage it
* Continues functioning regardless of personnel changes

## 5. Request SUDO Access
**Timeline:** Same day

**What it is:** Temporary administrative privileges on the server.

**Why:** Required for initial server setup tasks:
* Installing Node.js runtime
* Installing nginx web server
* Creating application directories
* Setting file permissions
* Configuring system services

**Note:** This is temporary elevated access for setup purposes only.

## 6. Configure Network
**Timeline:** 2-3 days

**What:** Configure network access and security for your application.

**Why:** Servers are secured by default with no external access.

**Requirements:**
* **Firewall rules** - Open specific network ports (80, 443, 3000) for web traffic
* **SSL Certificate** - Enable HTTPS encryption for secure connections
* **DNS** - Create domain name mapping so users can access your application by name instead of IP address
